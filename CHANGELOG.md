# Changelog

Notable changes to the Adamantium UI packages, in the form of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
All packages share one version.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `AdamantiumDesignerHost` names the designer host the build points the IDE's live preview to, in place of the one the
  package carries.
- `Adamantium.UI.Source.targets` in the repository root: a project in another repository builds on a checkout of this one
  instead of the package - the same references, generators and designer manifest - by importing it in place of the
  `PackageReference`.
- `AumlDirectiveInfo.Values`: the words a directive's value may be, for one that takes a fixed few (`x:KeepAlive`,
  `x:Load`, `x:Shared`, `x:CreateInDesignTime`). The build checks `x:KeepAlive` against the same list.
- Localization. An application's strings live in language files, one per table and language: `Strings.en.alang`,
  `Strings.ru.alang`, each a `<Language>` of `<Phrase Key="..." Text="..."/>` entries (or the text inside the tag, when
  it runs over lines); a placeholder may carry its own format in each language, `{time:HH:mm}`. The build turns each table into a class with
  a property per phrase and a method per phrase with placeholders (`PageOf(page, count)`), each language a class of its
  own; it checks the translations against the base file (`NeutralLanguage`, `en` by default) and warns of the phrases a
  translation lacks; an empty phrase is one not translated yet. `ILanguageTable` reads a table by key.
- `{Localize Strings.Close}` and `{Localize Strings.PageOf, page={Binding Page}, count=3}` in markup: a binding of its
  own kind (`Localize`, live as `LocalizeExpression`) to the string in the application's language, following the
  language and the bindings that fill its placeholders. It works wherever a binding does, inside a `MultiBinding` too. A
  key, a placeholder or an argument the table lacks fails the build. The designer shows them. In a control's template a
  placeholder takes the control's own value: `count={TemplateBinding PageCount}`.
- A phrase that changes with a number: `<Phrase Key="Files" Count="count" One="{count} file" Other="{count} files"/>`,
  a text per Unicode CLDR form (`Zero`, `One`, `Two`, `Few`, `Many`, `Other`); each language gives the forms it has and
  its own rules pick one (`PluralRules`, `PluralForm`). The build checks the forms against the language; a language may
  count a phrase its base language writes once.
- A phrase that changes with a value: `<Phrase Key="Notify" Select="on" True="Notifications on" False="Notifications off"/>`,
  a case named after each value - `True` or `False`, a member of an enum, `None` for null - and `Other` for the rest
  (`PhraseCases`). Beside `Select`, `Text` and `Count` are cases too, so an enum may have members of those names.
- A phrase as an argument of another: `size={Localize Strings.Bytes, count={Binding Size}}`.
- `{Localize CanvasStrings, Key={Binding Sort}}`: the key read from a binding - the word for a kind of thing. A key the
  table lacks is said as it is. `{x:Static Strings.Current}` hands a control the table itself, and
  `Languages.Say(table, key, ...)` says a phrase from code, for a thing named once as it is made.
- `Languages.Current` (and `UIApplication.Language`, `StartupLanguage`) switches the language while the application runs;
  every `{Localize}` and every binding that writes numbers or dates follows it.
- `<Language.Format>` in an application's language file sets how that language writes dates, times and numbers;
  `Binding.Culture` departs from it for one binding (`Invariant` or a language name).
- A library's tables are translated or overridden by an application's file of the same table name.
- The themes' strings are language tables of `Adamantium.UI.Themes` in English and Russian: `RibbonStrings`,
  `PropertyGridStrings`, `DataPagerStrings`, `ColorPickerStrings`, `DataGridStrings`, `CanvasStrings`,
  `InspectorStrings`, `WindowStrings`. Their keys are public: an application's `CanvasStrings.de.alang` translates the
  canvas.
- The language server completes and checks `.alang` files with the build's own generator, offers a quick fix that adds
  the strings a translation lacks, and completes `{Localize}` - tables, strings and placeholders.
- `DataGridSearchPanel.State`, `CurrentMatch` and `MatchCount`: where a search stands, for the theme to say.
- Properties for the words a control used to carry in its code, set by the themes: `ImageSourceProperty.DialogTitle`,
  `PicturesName`, `AllFilesName`; `InfiniteCanvas.ExportTitle`, `OpenTitle`, `DrawingsName`, `AllFilesName`,
  `DeleteTitle`, `ClearTitle`; `Phrases` - the table a control names things with - on `InfiniteCanvas`, `CanvasNode`
  and `DataGridGroupHeader`.
- `CanvasQuestion`: what the canvas asks before it deletes or clears, a control the theme gives its words and answers.
- `CanvasInspector.ItemCount` and `ICanvasItem.Parts`: numbers the theme says in words.

### Changed

- `IResolvedMember` has `IsStatic`, `IsPublic` and `ParameterNames`.
- `BindingBase.CreateExpression`: each kind of binding makes its own live expression, so a new kind needs no change to
  the binding engine.
- Bindings, `NumericUpDown`, `DataGrid`, `DataPager` and the drawing board write and read numbers and dates by the
  application's language (`Languages.Culture`), no longer by the operating system's culture. With no language set they
  use the invariant culture.
- The controls carry no words of their own; the themes give them in the application's language. `TreeDataGrid.NewRowHint`
  and `PropertyGrid.MixedText` have no default; an `ImageSourceProperty` line takes its tip from the theme; a floating
  docking window of a pane without a header has no title rather than "Panel"; the filter editor's operator and AND/OR
  lists are items of its template, in the order of `DataGridFilterOperator` and `DataGridFilterLogic`.
- Removed `DataPager.PageText` and `PageCountText`, sentences in English: the theme says "Page 3 of 12" from
  `PageNumberText`, `PageCount` and `IsEndKnown`. The search strip of `TreeDataGrid` no longer has `PART_Count`.
- Removed `CanvasInspector.Counted` (now `ItemCount`) and `InfiniteCanvas.DeleteQuestion` and `ClearQuestion`: the theme
  says the question, in the look of `CanvasQuestion`.
- A canvas tool's `Name` and `Description` are keys of the canvas's `Phrases` where it has them, and are said as they
  are where it does not; the framework's tools name theirs so (`Select`, `SelectDescription`). `ICanvasItem.Title` is
  what the person called the thing, empty by default: the theme names what it is by `Sort`. A `CanvasNode` has no title
  by default; its sockets are called by the phrases' "In 1", else by their number.
- A binding finds a property an object has through an interface, a default interface member included.

### Fixed

- Completion of `x:` directives in the language server: after `{` and `{x:` it offers `x:Null`, `x:Static` and `x:Type`;
  inside `{x:Static}` a type and then its public static fields and properties, base types included; the values of
  `x:Load`, `x:Shared`, `x:CreateInDesignTime` and `x:KeepAlive`. All of these offered nothing before.

- `DockingArea` and `PaneHost` threw "Invalid size returned for Measure" when offered unbounded space - an `Auto` row
  of a `Grid`, a `StackPanel`, a `ScrollViewer`. They now measure to what their panes need.
- An inspector line whose name, description or tip changed while shown - a language switch - kept the old words.
- A `DropDown` whose picked item's content changed went on showing the old content in its header.
- A number written out in markup, `count=5`, took the `Other` form of a counted phrase whatever it was.
- A `{Localize}` argument that was itself a `{Localize}` was built as its text; the designer read it right.
- A file dialog given a file type without a name showed an empty line for it; it shows the type's patterns.
